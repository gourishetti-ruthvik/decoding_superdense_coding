## Overview

**Superdense coding** is a quantum communication protocol that enables the transmission of two classical bits of information by sending only one qubit, provided that the sender and receiver share an entangled pair. This simulator provides a hands-on, visual environment to understand and experiment with the protocol, including quantum noise effects, security monitoring, and cryptographic analysis.

The application features a modern cosmic-themed interface that enhances the user experience while maintaining focus on the core quantum communication principles.

## How It Works

1. **Entanglement:**  
   Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled Bell state.

2. **Encoding:**  
   Alice encodes her 2-bit message using quantum gates (I, X, Z, XZ) on her qubit.

3. **Transmission:**  
   Alice sends her qubit to Bob through a quantum channel, which may introduce noise.

4. **Decoding:**  
   Bob performs a Bell measurement to recover the original 2 bits.

5. **Analysis:**  
   The simulator compares the sent and received bits, calculates fidelity, and updates analytics.

6. **Security:**  
   Optionally, the protocol monitors for eavesdropping using the CHSH inequality.
